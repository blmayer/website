    <h3><a name="app">gonuts</a></h3>
    <p>
        gonuts is a small tool just like
        <a href="awslambdarpc.html">awslambdarpc</a>, I made it
        to help sending requests to a nats server, you can pass
        arguments to send a file or data directly, this utility
        was developed to address my issues during work, but I decided
        to release it, as it may help other people. The code is
        currently on my <a href="github.com/blmayer/gonuts">repo</a>.
