            awslambdarpc is a small utility made to help debugging
            aws lambda functions running locally. Basically it makes
            a RPC request, you can pass arguments to send a file or
            data directly, this utility was developed to address my
            issues during work, but I decided to release it, as it
            may help other people. The code is currently on my GitHub
            and help can be found on the Medium article on the front
            page.
