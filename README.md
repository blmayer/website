# blmayer.dev

> This is the code to deploy my website on cloud run


## Usage

Install [template.sh](github.com/blmayer/template.sh), run `template static/`
and the resulting pages will be inside *out/static*. Git push triggers the
build on cloud run.

## Meta

This is my portfolio website, so I may post something usefull. Building this
was an opportunity to learn web development, and some tools.
